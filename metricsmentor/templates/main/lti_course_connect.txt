Dear colleague,

The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) offers instructors a TODO:

CTL learning designers can help you conceptualize and set up. We are also happy to offer in-person training sessions for your class. Please email us at ctl-metricsmentor@columbia.edu to request a consultation or training.

Metrics Mentor is designed and maintained here at the CTL, and we are always eager to receive ideas from the Columbia community â€“ please let us know how it goes! We hope you have a successful semester using Metrics Mentor.


Thanks,
The Metrics Mentor Team
